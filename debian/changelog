sway (1.2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (Closes: #940862)
  * d/control:
    - Bump version of wlroots build dependency to 0.7.0-2
      (new upstream version need wlroots 0.7.0)
    - Bump standards version to 4.4.0 (no changes required to
      make package compliant)
    - Set maintainer field to new team address and add nicoo to
      uploaders
  * d/patches:
    - Drop patch setting the project version - upstream fixed
      it in meson.build
  * d/rules:
    - Set DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND so we don't fail on deprecation warnings
      This is a workaround for https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/4553
  * d/gitlab-ci.yml:
    - Added configuration file for gitlab ci

sway (1.1.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (Closes: #927723)
  * d/control:
   - Add swaybg to dependencies as proposed by upstream
     ("swaybg is a required dependency of sway")
   - Add suckless-tools and x-terminal-emulator to Recommends,
     because the default sway config uses dmenu(1) (Closes: #924063)
   - Remove workaround for libwlroots run dependency from Depends:
     field. Since libwlroots1 we can rely on dpkg-shlibdeps
   - Make build-deps libsystemd-dev and libelogind-dev alternatives
   - Set meson version for build-dep like upstream
     does in meson.build (Closes: #927915)
   - Add libgl1-mesa-dri as dependency (Closes: #927990)
   - Set strict version of libwlroots dependency: the library breaks
     ABI between versions so we need the right version for building sway
   - Run wrap-and-sort on d/control
   - Add missing build-dependencies: libevdev-dev, libpixman-1-dev,
     libwayland-egl1 and libxbcommon-dev

  * d/patches
   - Add patch to install zsh completions into correct directory
     (Closes: #922777)
   - Add patch to replace urxvt in the default config file with
     x-terminal-emulator
   - Add patch to use the correct version string

  * d/copyright
   - Add missing files
   - Bump copyright years on debian/

  * d/sway.install
   - Add directory for manpages in section 7
   - Update path of zsh completions directory

sway (1.0~rc3-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version

 -- Birger Schacht <birger@rantanplan.org>  Tue, 19 Feb 2019 13:28:38 +0100

sway (1.0~rc2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
  * d/rules: remove sway_version argument, as the version
    is now set in the build file

 -- Birger Schacht <birger@rantanplan.org>  Tue, 12 Feb 2019 19:49:19 +0100

sway (1.0~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Remove swaylock and swayidle: they are now separate packages
  * Tidied up d/sway.install: now that swaylock and swayidle
    are separate source packages, its easier to use wildcards
  * Specify versioned build-dependencies as required by upstream.
    Thus explicitly listing wayland-protocols and libsystemd as
    build-dep with versions and adding versions to scdoc build-dep.
  * Adding libelogind build-dep
  * Bump version of libwlroots-dev build-dep
  * Remove references to swaygrab (it was removed from the upstream
    package; see grim(1) for an alternative)
  * Update Recommends and Suggests: one of the sway wallpapers is
    configured as background in the shipped config file, thus the
    package containing the wallpapers is recommended. swayidle and
    swaylock are also configured in the shipped config file, but
    commented, thus they are only suggested
  * Make versioned run dependency on libwlroots0 explicit
