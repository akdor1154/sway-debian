sway (1.1~rc2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (Closes: #927723)
  * d/control: add swaybg to dependencies as proposed by
    upstream ("swaybg is a required dependency of sway")
  * Add patch do install zsh completions into correct
    directory (Closes: #922777)
  * d/control: add suckless-tools and x-terminal-emulator to
    Recommends, because the default sway config uses dmenu(1)
    (Closes: #924063)
  * d/patches/0002-Replace-urxvt-with-x-terminal-emulator.patch
    Replace urxvt in the default config file with x-terminal-emulator
  * d/control: remove workaround for libwlroots run dependency, as
    that's fixed since libwlroots1
  * Make build-deps libsystemd-dev and libelogind-dev exclusive
  * d/control: set meson version for build-dep like upstream
    does in meson.build (Closes: #927915)
  * d/control: add libgl1-mesa-dri as dependency (Closes: #927990)
  * d/control: Set exact version of libwlroots dependency: the
    library breaks ABI between versions so we need the right
    version for building sway
  * Run wrap-and-sort on d/control
  * d/control: Add missing build-dependencies

sway (1.0~rc2-1) experimental; urgency=medium

sway (1.0~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Remove swaylock and swayidle: they are now separate packages
  * Tidied up d/sway.install: now that swaylock and swayidle
    are separate source packages, its easier to use wildcards
  * Specify versioned build-dependencies as required by upstream.
    Thus explicitly listing wayland-protocols and libsystemd as
    build-dep with versions and adding versions to scdoc build-dep.
  * Adding libelogind build-dep
  * Bump version of libwlroots-dev build-dep
  * Remove references to swaygrab (it was removed from the upstream
    package; see grim(1) for an alternative)
  * Update Recommends and Suggests: one of the sway wallpapers is
    configured as background in the shipped config file, thus the
    package containing the wallpapers is recommended. swayidle and
    swaylock are also configured in the shipped config file, but
    commented, thus they are only suggested
  * Make versioned run dependency on libwlroots0 explicit
